# AussieDropBear's Staff Utilites

Drag and Drop ``AussieDropBears-StaffUtil`` to your resources folder, then add ``ensure AussieDropBears-StaffUtil`` to your server.cfg or resources.cfg

# Permissions

Make sure to add these permissions to your server.cfg or permissions.cfg.

add_ace group.staff Yeet.Player allow -- Allows Staff to use the /yeetscene commands
add_ace group.staff chatclear allow -- Allows staff to use the /chatclear command


If you don't have a ``group.staff`` ace permission simply change it to the ace permission your staff are inheriting from.

# Dependencies
