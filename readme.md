# Xanex/Joaquin's Staff Utilites 

Drag and Drop ``Xanex-StaffUtil`` to your resources folder, then add ``ensure Xanex-StaffUtil`` to your server.cfg or resources.cfg

# Permissions

Make sure to add these permissions to your server.cfg or permissions.cfg.

add_ace group.staff Yeet.Player allow -- Allows Staff to use the /yeetscene commands
add_ace group.staff chatclear allow -- Allows staff to use the /chatclear command


If you don't have a ``group.staff`` ace permission simply change it to the ace permission your staff are inheriting from.

# Dependencies 

None, i may add in the future support of Badger_Discord_API but ACE Permissions Work Fine.

Kinda requires ``DiscordAcePermissions`` resource by OfficialBadger see his docs for setting up ``DiscordAcePermissions``
